            Ayushman Bharat Yogna aims to transform the delivery of health
            services from a sectoral and segmented approach to one that is
            comprehensive and needs-based. This programme seeks to implement
            ground-breaking interventions to holistically address the primary,
            secondary, and tertiary healthcare system (covering prevention,
            promotion, and ambulatory care). With two interconnected components,
            Ayushman Bharat uses an integrated system of care approach.
